ASEE Conferences Latex Template
===============================

A Latex template for ASEE conference proceedings papers. This template is not affiliated with the American Society for Engineering Education and comes with no warranty or guarantee.

ASEE provides a list of formatting requirements on its [website](https://www.asee.org/events/Conferences-and-Meetings).


## For the draft paper
### Title Page (top part of first page only)
1. Title of Paper: The title must be centered with at least a one and one-half inch margin on the 
left and right.
2. Font: Times New Roman typeface is required, bold faced, 14 point.
3. Author and Affiliation: Submissions are done in a double blind. No author or affiliation 
information is to be included on any abstracts or draft papers.
4. Footers: These will be automatically added to your papers. Please leave them blank.

### Body of the Paper (beginning under the title information on the first page and continuing with all subsequent pages)
1. First Page: The paper will be in a one-column format with left justification.
There must be a 1 inch margin on the left, right, and bottom.
Font: Times New Roman typeface is required, 12 point, skipping one line between paragraphs.
2. Second and All Subsequent Pages: There must be a 1 inch margin all around (top, bottom, 
right, left) in one column format, left justification, skipping one line between paragraphs.
Font: Times New Roman typeface is required, 12 point, using only standard symbols and 
abbreviations in text and illustrations.
3. Abstracts: Abstracts are not required, but can be included between the title and the body of the 
paper, but not on a separate page.
4. Headings: Headings are not required but can be included. If used, headings must be left 
justified, lowercase, with the same font and size as the body of the paper. There must be only 
one blank line between the heading and the paragraph.
5. Page Numbering: Do not number the pages.
6. Length: There is no set limit for the number of pages a paper can or must be.

### Bibliographic Information (following body of paper)
#### NOTE: ASEE doesn't provide guidance on formatting of bibliographic information aside from the reference style. Below I've used some formatting recommendations from what ASEE used to request.
1. Format: The bibliography must begin 4 spaces below the body of the paper using the same 
margins as the body.
2. Font: Times New Roman typeface is required, 10 point.
3. Referencing: The preferred reference style is IEEE

### Biographical Information
Biographical information is to be saved in Monolith on the Author/Co-Author page. It will be 
automatically added to your paper.

### Other
* Do not include session numbers in any part of the document, unless specifically requested to 
do so by a call for papers.
* Do not include any author or affiliation information in your draft paper so that your draft paper 
is able to receive a blind review.


## For the final paper
### Same as for draft paper except:
* Author and Affiliation: No author information is to be included since that is saved in Monolith. 
Any placeholders used to disguise affiliation in the draft paper (such as “University of _____”) 
should be replaced with the affiliation information
